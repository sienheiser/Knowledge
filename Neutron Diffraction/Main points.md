Need some sort of prode that can see at interatomic distances ($10^{-10}$ m). 

Can use X-rays. But only good for heavy elements. Therefore, atoms with many electrons scatter X-rays readily compared to elements like hydrogen.

Could study scattering of electrons from material. But charged particles interact strongly. This suggests that electrons could be used to study the surface of a material.

Neutrons could be used. They are not charged. They only interact through the nuclear force. The nuclear force has an interaction range of $10^{-15}$ m. To neutrons dense materials are no longer dense because they only interact with the nucleaus. 

Is there a difference in neutrons interacting between protons and other neutrons in the nucleus.

Analysis of materials with neutrons is a *signal-limited technique* because neutrons beams are low intesity and neutrons are hard to detect.

Typical wavelenght of a neutron in such scattering experiments is about $10^{-10}$ m. Neutrons scatter off nuclei isotropically because the nuclear force is 10000 times smaller than the neutron wavelength.

We represent the the incedent neutrons as $e^{-ikx}$ which are wavefronts. The outgoing neutrons as 
$$(-b/r)e^{-ikr}$$
where $r$ is the radius from the scattering center. The $1/r$ factor takes care of the inverse square law which applies to all waves. $b$, refered to the scattering length of the nucleus, measure the strength of the interaction between the neutron and scattering nucleus.

We assume these collisions are [[Elastics Collisions (CM)|elastic collision]]. So there is no change in the neutrons energy after the collision. Therefore the same $k$ appears before and after the collision.

The relation between the scattering length $b$ and the cross-section $\sigma$ is 
$$
\sigma = 4\pi b^2.
$$
The scattering lenght for neutrons has to be determined experimentally as there is no reliable theory to calculate it.

Neutron interaction between different isotopes can be distinguished.

There has been a result that states that the scattered intensiy of neutrons is proportional to the Fourier transform of a function that gives the probability of finding two atom a certain distance apart. Because of this we can use neutrons for probing. 

There are two types of scattering effects. 
1. Coherent scattering: The neutron wave interacts with the whole sample so that scattered waves from different nuclei intefere with each other.  This gives information about structure of materials. 
2. Elastic coherent scattering: Tells us about the equilibrium structure.
3. Inelastic coherent scattering: Tells us about the collective motion of atoms
4. Incoherent scattering: The neutron wave interacts independently with each nucleus in the sample so that the scattered waves from different nuclei do not interfere with each other. This probvides information about atomic difussion.

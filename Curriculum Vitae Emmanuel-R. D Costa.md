## Work Experience

### Coding
1. Built scripts that helped with generation of test specifications: https://gitlab.esss.lu.se/emmanueldcosta/specification-generator
	1. I came onto the job as a technical writer. We were going to start a big testing phase which required many test specifications for different systems. I built a database that collected relevant data for our group and wrote scripts to generate the test specifications.
	
2. Built a website for the team to get overview information: https://gitlab.esss.lu.se/emmanueldcosta/mps-overview 
	1. Here I learnt how to display information from the database to the website. It is still under development. 
	
3. Built a package to run VBA commands through python: https://gitlab.esss.lu.se/emmanueldcosta/pyword 
	1. When I initially started scripting documents I had to write code in VBA. VBA is not compatible with GIT which made version control difficult. My colleague and I were able to find a work around that that allows us to use python instead.

4. Learnt how to build EPICS IOCs, I mainly write scripts to generate EPICS code and operator interfaces (OPIs).

### Testing
I have been part three big testing campaigns
### Crate testing 
Our team had manufactured crates and I was tasked with checking if they were built according to the electrical drawings. The main challenge for this campaign was tracking the small discrepancies that between electrical drawings and manufactured crates. The process I used to make sure these issues were addressed was by creating jira tickets with photos of discrepancy in the crate and electrical drawings and write down what exactly is the problem. So we had context.

### Firmware testing
We use a tester developed in-house to test firmware. The main challenge is when a test fails. I use debugging tools to look at what happens step by step and isolate where the test is failing. The fun part is hypothesising what causes the failure and trying to fix it. 

## Programming
1. Python: I am very comfortable and experienced in using Python to develop algorithms and analyse data. 
2. Haskell: I have basic knowledge of Haskell.
3. SQL: I can build SQL databases and query them.
4. VHDL: I can build testbenches in VHDL to test entities or packages.
5. GitHub: I am experienced in using GitHub for version control.


## Languages
My first language is English. I also speak intermediate Romanian and basic Swedish and Hindi. I am currently learning Swedish.

## Extracurricular Activites
In my free time I am learning a new programming language called Haskell. I like to program animation videos. Currently, I like to row and boulder.

Suppose we have distribution of matter that is able to flow. Then at any point in space (this space need not be a physical space see [[Phase Points as Gas|phase points as gas]]). The followling equation holds true

$$
\frac{\partial \mathcal{Q}}{\partial t}+\nabla\cdot(\vec{v}\mathcal{Q}) = 0
$$

where $\mathcal{Q}$ is the distribution function of matter, $\vec{v}$ is the velocity of matter. Note we take the divergence in the above expression.

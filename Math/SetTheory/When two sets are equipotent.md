*Proposition:* Let $n,m\in\mathbb{N}$. Then the sets $N=\{1,2,3,...,n\}$ and $M=\{1,2,3,...,m\}$ are [[Equipotent|equipotent]] if and only if $n=m$.

*Proof:* Let the two sets be equipotent. Suppose that $n\neq m$. Since the two sets are equipotent there exists a bijective function $f:N\rightarrow M$. WLOG $n<m$. Since $f$ is a bijection only one element of $N$ gets mapped to one element $M$. Since $n < m$, there will be some elements of $M$ that are not mapped to. This is a contradiction since $f$ is a bijective map. Therefore $n=m$.

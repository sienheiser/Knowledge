aliases: [countably infinite family of countable infinite sets]
---

*Lemma:* If $S_1, S_2,...,S_n,...$ is a [[Countable, uncountable|countably infinite]] family of countably infinite sets such that $S_i\cap S_j=\emptyset$ for $i\neq j$, then $\bigcup_{i=1}^{\infty}S_i$ is a countable infinite set.

*Proof:* Since each set $S_i$ is a countably infinite set we know $S_i=\{s_{i1},s_{i2},....\}$. Now put $s_{ij}$ in the $i$th row and $j$th column of an array. Then we can list all the elements in the following manner

we have created a list. The list is infinite because each $S_i$ is infinite. So $\bigcup_{i=1}^\infty S_i$ is countably infinite.


*Remark:* Here we assumed that the sets $S_i$ and $S_j$ are pair wise disjoint for $i\neq j$. We can remove this condition and the lemma is still true. Since union of the same elements does not add anything extra.

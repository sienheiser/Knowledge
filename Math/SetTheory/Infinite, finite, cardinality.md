#SetTheory
*Definitons:* Let $S$ be a set.
1. Then $S$ is said to be **finite** if it is the empty set, $\emptyset$, or it is equipotent to $\{1,2,3,...,n\}$, for some $n\in\mathbb{N}$.
2. If $S$ is not finite, then it is said to be **infinite**.
3. If $S$~$\{1,2,3,...,n\} then $S$ is said to have **cardinality $n$**, which is denoted by $\text{card }S=n$.
4. If $S=\emptyset$, then the cardinality is said to be zero, which is denoted $\text{card }\emptyset=0$.

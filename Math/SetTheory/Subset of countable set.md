*Proposition:* If $S$ is a [[Countable, uncountable|countable]] set and $T\subset S$. Then $T$ is a countable set.

*Proof:* Since $S$ is countable it can be written as a list $S=\{s_1,s_2,s_3,......\}$ (it can be finite or infinite). 

Let $t_1$ be the first $s_i$ in $T$. Let $t_2$ be the second $s_i\in T$ and so on. If $T=\{t_1,t_2,...,t_n\}$ for some $n$, then $T$ is finite. If $T$ is not finite then we obtain a list $T=\{t_1,t_2,...\}$. This list contains all the members of $T$ because if $s_i\in T$. Then we reach $s_i$ no later than the $i$th step. Therefore $T$ is countably infinite. Hence, $T$ is countable.

Before we prove that the set $\mathbb{Q}$ is [[Countable, uncountable|countably infinite]] we prove a simpler statement.

*Lemma:* The set, $\mathbb{Q}^{>0}$, of all positive rational numbers is countably infinite.

*Proof:* Define $S_i = \{1/i,2/i,3/i,....\}$. Then 

$$
\mathbb{Q}^{>0} = \bigcup_{i=1}^{\infty}S_i.
$$
By [[Countably infinite family of countably infinite sets]] $\mathbb{Q}^{>0}$ is a countably infinite set.

*Theorem:* The set $\mathbb{Q}$ of all rational numbers is countably infinite.

*Proof:* We know $\mathbb{Q}^{>0}$ is countably infinite. Futhermore, the set, $\mathbb{Q}^{<0}$ of all negative rational numbers is [[Equipotent|equipotent]] to $\mathbb{Q}^{>0}$, hence $\mathbb{Q}^{<0}$ is countably infinite. Then the union of $\mathbb{Q}^{>0}$, $\mathbb{Q}^{<0}$ and $\{0\}$ is also countably infinite set by [[Countable family of countable sets]].

*Corollary:* Every set of rational numbers is countable.

*Proof:* Take any set of $S$ of rational numbers. Then $S\subseteq \mathbb{Q}$. By [[Subset of countable set|subset of countable set]] $S$ is countably infinite.

aliases: [product of countably infinite sets]
---

*Proposition:* If $S$ and $T$ are [[Countable, uncountable|countably infinite]] infinite sets then the product set $S\times T = \{\langle s,t\rangle|s\in S,t\in T\}$ is a countably infinite set.  

*Proof:* Let $S = \{s_1,s_2,...\}$ and $T=\{t_1,t_2,...\}$. Then 
$$
S\times T = \bigcup_{i=1}^{\infty}\{\langle s_i,t_1\rangle, \langle s_i, t_2\rangle,..., \langle s_i, t_n\rangle,...  \}
.$$
The product of the two set is a union of countably infinite family of countably infinite sets. By [[Countably infinite family of countably infinite sets]] $S\times T$ is a countably infinite set.

*Corollary:* Every finite product of countable sets is a countable set.

*Proof:* 
Case 1: finite product of countably infinite sets. $S_1, S_2,... S_n$ be countably infinite sets. Then $S_1\times S_2$ is a countably infinite set by previous proposition. Furthermore $(S_1\times S_2)\times S_3$ is a countably infinite set by previous proposition and so on. Therefore the finite product of countably infinite sets is a countable set.

Case 2: Finite product of finite sets. This is clearly finite.

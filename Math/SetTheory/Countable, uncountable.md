1. The set $S$ is said to be **countably infinite** (or **denumerable**) if it is [[Equipotent|equipotent]] to $\mathbb{N}$.
2. The set $S$ is said to be **countable** if it is finite or countably infintie.
3. If set $S$ is countably infinite then it is said to have cardinality $\aleph_0$, denoted by $\text{card }S=\aleph_0$.
4. A set $S$ is said to be **uncountable** if it is not countable.

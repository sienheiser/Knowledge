#GroupTheory 
Suppose we have a finite group $G$ with $n$ elements. Then we may be able to define a multiplication table which looks like:

In each row a group element can only appear once. To see this suppose that there in the i$th$ row there appears a group element twice that is $g_ig_j = g_ig_k$ for $j\neq k$. This implies $g_j = g_k$ which is a contradiction. This is also true for colomns

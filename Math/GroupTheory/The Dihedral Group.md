#GroupTheory 

The dihedral group $D_n$ is the set of transformations that leave an n-sider polygon the same. This means that rotations with angle $2\pi/n$ about the center and reflections belong to $D_n$. Example $D_3$: $\{I,R,R^2,r,Rr,R^2r\}$ where $R = \frac{2\pi}{3}$ and $r$ is reflection across one of the symmetric axis. $D_n$ always has $2n$ elements.

In notation language

$$
D_n = \langle R,r|R^n = I, r^2 = I, Rr=rR^{-1}\rangle
$$

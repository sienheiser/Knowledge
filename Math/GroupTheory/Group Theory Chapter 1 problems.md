***Problem 1:*** The center of a group $G$ denoted as $Z$ is defined to the set of elements $\{z_1,z_2,.....\}$ that commute with all elements of $G$, that is $z_i g = g z_i$. Prove that $Z$ is an abelian subgroup of $G$.
Proof: Suppose we have set of elements $\{z_1,z_2,...\}$ that commute with all elements of $G$. Then we know that the identity of $G$ must belong to $Z$ by definition.  We need to show that the elements of $Z$ belong to $G$. 

way 1: By definition of $Z$ we know $z_i g = g z_i$ however for this to make sense the composition between $z_i$ and $g$ must be defined. This is only the case if $z_i$ belongs to $G$.  Now we know that the elements $Z$ belong to $G$. Then we can say that $Z\subseteq G$  meaning $Z$ is a subgroup of $G$. Since the elements of $Z$ commute with all elements of $G$ then the elements $Z$ commute with themselves. Therefore, $Z$ is an abelian subgroup of $G$.


***Problem 2***: 
![[GroupTheoryC1P2.png]]
Rough proof: Suppose we have a group $G$ with 4 elements $\{I,g_1,g_2,g_3\}$. Then take sum $\sum_{i}f(g_i)$ clearly $\sum_{i}f(g_i) = \sum_{i}f(g_ig_j)$ since $g_i g_j$ is just another element of the same group. 

***Problem 4***: Find all groups of order 6.

Ans: The order of a group is the number of elements that belong to the group. So we want to find all possible groups with 6 elements. This can be done by using multiplication tables.

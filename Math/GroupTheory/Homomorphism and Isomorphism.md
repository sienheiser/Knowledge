A map $f:G\rightarrow G'$ is said to be a ***homomorphism*** if it preserves the multiplicative structure of $G$ i.e. $g_1\cdot g_2 = f(g_1)\cdot f(g_2)$. This means the identity $I$ from $G$ gets mapped to the identity of $G'$.

A ***homomorphism*** is said to become an ***isomorphism*** if the map is one to one and onto.

#### Exmaples

The additive group of integers mod $N$ is isomorphic to the group of $N$th roots of 1 $Z_N$.

Interestingly the group $Z_p \otimes Z_q$ and $Z_{pq}$ are isomorphic ir $p$ and $q$ are relatively prime. 

The groups $SO(3)$ and $U(1)$ are isomorphic with map $f(R(\phi)) = e^{i\phi}$.

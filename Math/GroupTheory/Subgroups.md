#GroupTheory 
Given a group $G$ with elements $g_i$. If a subset of $G$ also forms a group $H$ then $H$ is known as the ***subgroup*** of $G$.


Examples:
1. $SO(2)\subset SO(3)$, rotations in 2D Eulidean space is a subset of rotations in 3D Euclidean space.
2. $S_m \subset s_n$ for $m<n$, where $S_n$ is the permutation group.

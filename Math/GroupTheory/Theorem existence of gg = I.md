Theorem: Suppose we have group $G$ with even [[Order|order]]. There exists atleast one element $g$, which is not the identity $I$, that also squares to identity $g^2 = 1$.


Proof: Suppose $G$ has order $n$ which is an even number. Then by Caley's theorem there is some subgroup of $S_n$ that is isomorphic to $G$. Let $H_n$ be that subgroup.

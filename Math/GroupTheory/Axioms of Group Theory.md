#GroupTheory
A group $G$ is a set whose elements $g_i$ satisfy the following propertices
1. If $g_i, g_j$ belong to $G$ then $g_i \cdot g_j = g_k$ belongs to $G$.
2. Associativity: $(g_i\cdot g_j)\cdot g_k = g_i\cdot (g_j\cdot g_k)$
3. Existence of the Identity: There exist a group element known as the identity that is denoted $I$ such that $I\cdot g_i = g_i\cdot I = g_i$.
4. Existence of the inverse: For every group elemnt $g_i$ there exists a unique group element  known as the inverse of $g_i$ and is denoted as $g_i^{-1}$, such that $g_i\cdot g_i^{-1} = g_i^{-1}\cdot g_i = I$.

#GroupTheory 
We will use the [[Axioms of Group Theory|axioms]] to verify whether the following examples are groups.

#### Rotations in 3D Euclidean space
It is clear that composition of two rotations give another rotaions. Then rotations are also associative since rotations can be represented as matrices and matrices are associative.  Doing no rotations is the identity of the group. Finally, inverse rotations can be defined physically.

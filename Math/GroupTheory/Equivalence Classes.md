#GroupTheory 

*Definition*: In a group $G$, two elements $g$ and $g'$ are said to be equivalent $g\sim g'$ if there exits another element $f$ such that $g' = f^{-1}gf$. 

Equvalence is transitive i.e. if $g\sim g'$ and $g'\sim g''$ then $g\sim g''$. 

All elements that essentially do the same get put into a class. For example in permutation group $S_n$ all 2-cycles are equivalent if we ignore what object they change. Does this mean all three 3-cycles are also equivalent? Not necessarily the case. If we consider $S_n$ then yes, if we consider alternating group $A_n$ then no.

1. In an abelian group, all elements are in their own class. 
2. The identity is always in its own class
3. Consider a class $c$ with elements $\{g_1,....,g_{n_c}\}$. Then the inverse of these $n_c$ elements, namely, $\{g_1^{-1},...,g_{n_c}^{-1}\}$ also form a class denoted $\bar{c}$.

#GroupTheory 

Presentations is a notations that defines the structure of a group compactly. For example the presentation for $Z_4$ is 
$$
Z_4:\langle A|A^4 = I \rangle.
$$
The notations states that if any element from $Z_4$ is taken and multiplied by itself four times then we get the identity. Another example is

$$
Z_2\otimes Z_2:\langle A,B: A^2=B^2=I, AB = BA\rangle.
$$
The notations states: squaring any elements gives the identity, all elements commute.

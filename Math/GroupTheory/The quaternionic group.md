#GroupTheory 


Hamilton generalized the imaginary unit $i$ by adding two other units $j$ and $k$ that obey the following multiplication rules 

$$
i^2 = j^2 = k^2 = -1, \quad \text{and} \quad ij = -ji,jk = -kj , ki = -ik.
$$
The group consists of: $1,-1,i,-i,j,-j,k,-k$. These elements rotate quaternions.

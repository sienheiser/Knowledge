#GroupTheory 
Given two groups $F$ and $G$ where their elements are denoted by $f$ and $g$ respectively. We can define another group using the direct product: $H$ = $F\otimes G$. An element from the group $H$ is denotes as $(f,g)$. The composition between two elements of $H$ is defined as $(f',g')\cdot(f,g) = (f'f,g'g)$. If $F$ and $G$ have $n$ and $m$ elements respectively then $H$ has $nm$ elements.

#### Example: Klein's Vierergruppe
Suppose we make a group defined as $Z_2\otimes Z_2$, the group has four elements: (1,1), (-1,1), (1,-1) and (-1,-1). Note that eventhough $Z_4$ has four elements these two groups are not the same, as taking the square of any element in $Z_2\otimes Z_2$ gives the identity. This is not the case with $Z_4$.

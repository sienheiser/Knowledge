Suppose we are told to walk in a loop $\gamma(\lambda)$ without changing the direction of our nose. Along the loop our nose forms a vector field $Y$. This idea of changing moving around without changing direction on nose can be quantified using the directional derivative
$$
\nabla_{\mathcal{v}_\gamma}Y = 0.
$$

Given the following data $(S^2,\mathcal{O},\mathcal{A})$ we cannot say anything about the shape of a sphere untill we add a specific $\nabla$ that gives the round sphere so we have $(S^2,\mathcal{O},\mathcal{A},\nabla)$. This means there is information about curvature in $\nabla$.

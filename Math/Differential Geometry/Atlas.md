#DifferentialGeometry
Let $(M,\mathcal{O})$ be a topological manifold. An atlas  is defined as the set 
$$
\mathcal{A} = \{(U_{\alpha},x_{\alpha})|\alpha\in A\}
$$
where $A$ is an index set, $U_{\alpha} \in \mathcal{O}$ and $x_{\alpha}$ is a chart for open set $U_{\alpha}$  with the property that $\bigcup_{\alpha}U_\alpha = M$.

One chart for $d$-topological manifold defines $d$ individual coordinate maps.

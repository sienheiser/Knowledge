Suppose we have a smooth manifold  and on the manifold we have a curve $\gamma: \mathbb{R}\rightarrow M$. Suppose $\gamma(\lambda_0) = p$. 

The velocity at $p$ is the linear map 

$$
\mathcal{v}_{\gamma,p}:C^{\infty}(M)\tilde{\rightarrow}\mathbb{R}.
$$

where $C^{\infty}(M)$ is the set of all smooth function on the manifold that is a vector space. In notation we define the velocity to be 
$$
f\rightarrow \mathcal{v}_{\gamma,p}(f):= (f\circ \gamma)'(\lambda_0)
$$
where the derivative is with respect to $\lambda_0$.

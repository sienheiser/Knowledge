The eigenvalues for a (1,1) tensor is well defined. However this concept does not make sense for a (0,2) tensor. The idea of signature is used. It can be shown that any metric tensor can be rewritten as a matrix whose diagonal only has 1's proceeded by -1's proceeded by 0's. For a non degenerate metric it only has 1's and -1's in its diagonal.

*Definiton:* A metric is called Rimannian if its signature is (+++...+++) or (---....-----). Lorentian (-+++++.....) or (+------.....) and psuedo Riemannian for any other signature.

Definition: A bundle is a triple
$$
E\xrightarrow[]{\pi} M
$$
where $E$ is a smooth manifold called the total space of the bundle, $M$ is a smooth manifold called the base space of the bundle and $\pi$ is a surjective smooth map called the projection map of the bundle.

Any three pieces of data like this is called a bundle

### Example
![[bundleExample.png]]

In the above picture the infinite cylinder is the total space $E$, the circle in the cylinder is the base space $M$ and the lines that projecct from $E$ to $M$ is the projection map $\pi$ of the bundle. However any choice $E$, $M$ and $\pi$ is a bundle.

*Definiton:* A finite Lie subalgebra $(L,[\cdot,\cdot])$ is said to be a symmetry of a metric tensor field $g$ if for all vector fields $X\in L$
$$
g((h^X_\lambda)_*(A),(h^X_\lambda)_*(B))\stackrel{!}{=} g(A,B)
$$
for all $\lambda\in\mathbb{R}$ and $A$ and $B$ are vector fields. Where $h^X_\lambda$ is the [[Flow of a vector field|flow of a vector field]].

The intuition is comparing two different points and looking if the metric gives the same value.

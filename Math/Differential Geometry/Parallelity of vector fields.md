*Definition:* Suppose we are given $(M,\mathcal{O},\mathcal{A},\nabla)$. A vector field X on M is said to be parallelity trasported along a smooth curve $\gamma:\mathbb{R}\rightarrow M$ if 
$$
\nabla_{\mathcal{v}_\gamma}X = 0
$$
where we are using field notation above. In point wise notation
$$
(\nabla_{\mathcal{v}_{\gamma,\gamma(\lambda)}}X)_{\gamma(\lambda)} = 0.
$$

A weaker condition than parallely transported is parallel

$$
\nabla_{\mathcal{v}_\gamma}X = \mu X
$$
where we get the a scaled version of the original vector field

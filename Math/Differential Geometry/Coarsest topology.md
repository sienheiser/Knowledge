We construct topology on $TM$ that is the coarsest topology such that map $\pi$ becomes just continuous. We could take discrete topology of $TM$ however then we do not use any data from $\pi$. This is known as initial topology w.r.t $\pi$.  The coarsest topology for $TM$ is the following
$$
\mathcal{O}_{TM} = \{preim_{\pi}(u)|u\in\mathcal{O}\}
$$
such that $\mathcal{O}$ is the topology of $M$ we defined earlier. We can show that $\mathcal{O}_{TM}$ is a topology.

aliases: [lie algebra of a vector field]

We defined $\Gamma(TM)$ as the set of all vector fields that behaved as a $C^{\infty}(M)$ module in [[gamma(TM)]] and [[gamma(TM)-module]]. We know $[X,Y]\in\Gamma(TM)$  Any structure which satisfies the following three criterias 

1. $[X,Y]$ = -$[Y,X]$
2. $[\lambda X+Z,Y] = \lambda[X,Y]+[Z,Y]$ where $\lambda\in\mathbb{R}$
3. $[X,[Y,Z]]+[Z,[X.Y]]+[Y,[Z,X]] = 0$ 

is known as a Lie algebra. We denote the Lie algebra of the vector fields as $(\Gamma(TM),[\cdot,\cdot])$.

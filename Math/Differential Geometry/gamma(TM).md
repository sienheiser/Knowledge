We know $C^{\infty}(M)$ is a vector space with all smooth functions on $M$. That means we can take any two elements from $C^{\infty}(M)$ add them or multiply them  meaning we have $(C^{\infty}(M),+,\cdot)$.  However, not all elements of $C^{\infty}(M)$ have an inverse meaning that it is a vector space on a [[Ring|ring]]. 

Let us define a set 
$$
\Gamma(TM) = \{\chi:TM\rightarrow M|\chi\text{ is smooth section/vectorfield}\} 
$$
where $TM$ and $M$ belong to a [[Tangent Bundle of a Smooth Manifold|tangent bundle]] and $\Gamma(TM)$ essentially consists all of the possible vector fields from a tangent bundle.

#DifferentialGeometry
definition: suppose we have [[Math/Differential Geometry/Bundles|bundle]] $E\xrightarrow []{\pi}M$. Then a fiber over $p\in M$ is defined to be 
$$
:= preim_\pi({p}).
$$

### Example

![[bundleExample.png]]

The above example is a bundle, the straight lines that project to a point $p$ on the base space are fibers.

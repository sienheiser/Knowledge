*Definition:* A curve $\gamma: I\rightarrow M$ is called an integral curve of vector field $X$ if 

$$
\mathcal{v}_{\gamma,\gamma(\lambda)} = X_{\gamma(\lambda)}
$$

Basically the tangent vectors of a curve should be the same as the vector field as the tangent vector passes through the vector field.

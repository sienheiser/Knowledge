#DifferentialGeometry
Definiton: Suppose we have a [[Math/Differential Geometry/Bundles|bundle]] $E\xrightarrow[]{\pi} M$. A section $\sigma$ is a map $M\xrightarrow[]{\sigma} E$ such that $\pi\circ\sigma = \text{identity}_M:= \text{id}_M$.

The sections are the fields, they can be vector fields, covector fields and general fields. The type of field we get depends on the choice of total space $E$.

### Example
![[bundleExample.png]]
In the above picture we have depicted a  [[Math/Differential Geometry/Bundles|bundle]] and a few [[Fiber|fibers]] for different points of the base manifold of the bundle. We require the section $\sigma$ to take a point $p$ and map on the same [[Fiber|fiber]] that was mapped to the point $p$ that is after applying the section $\sigma$ to a point $p$ on the base space and then applying the projection map on the result we expect to return to point $p$.

The SVD decomposes a matrix into a rotation, scaling and another rotation matrix. 
$$
M = U\Lambda V^{\dagger}, \text{with}\quad U^{\dagger}U = V^{\dagger}V = 1.
$$

If matrix $M$ is a $m\times n$. Then in the SVD above $U$ is a $m\times m$ matrix, $\lambda$ is a $m\times n$ matrix and $V^{\dagger}$ is a $n\times n$ matrix.

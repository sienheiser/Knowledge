The Dirichlet conditions are conditions that a function $f(x)$ must satisfy in order to have a [[Fourier Series|Fourier series]]. The conditions are :

1. $f(x+L) = f(x)$ for all $x$ in a period $L$.
2. The function $f(x)$ must have finite number of discontinuites in period $L$.
3. The function $f(x)$ must have finite numer of minimums and maximums in period $L$.
4. The integral $\int_{x_0}^{x_0+L}|f(x)|dx <\ infty$.

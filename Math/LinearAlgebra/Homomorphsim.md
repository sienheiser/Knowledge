Let $(V,+,\cdot)$ and $(W,+,\cdot)$ be vector spaces. The homomorphism between the two vector spaces is the set of all linear maps between the two vector spaces defined as 
$$
\{\phi|\phi:V\tilde{\rightarrow} W\}= Hom(V,W)
$$
where $\tilde{\rightarrow}$ defines a linear map.

The set $Hom(V,W)$ can be made a vector space by defining addition $\oplus$ and s-multiplcation "$\odot$" as 
$$
\begin{aligned}
(\psi \oplus \phi)(v) :=& \psi(v)+_W \phi (v)\\
(\lambda\odot \phi)(v) :=& \lambda\cdot_w \phi(v)\\
\end{aligned}
$$
where $v\in V$.

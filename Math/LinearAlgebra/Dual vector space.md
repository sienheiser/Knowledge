Dual vector space is a special case of [[Homomorphsim|homomorphism]]. It is defined to be the set of all linear maps between vector spaces $(V,+,\cdot)$ and ($\mathbb{R},+,\cdot$) 

$$
V^* := *\{\phi|\phi:V\tilde{\rightarrow}\mathbb{R}\}.
$$

The dual vector space can be created $(V^*,+,\cdot)$

### Example
We look at the vector space of polynomials. We know that $\int_0^1 p(x)dx =$ number meaning $\int_0^1dx$ is a covector.

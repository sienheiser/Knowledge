We want to find the open sets of subset $[1,2]$ of $\mathbb{R}$. We can do this by first finding the induced basis of the subspace like in example [[Basis of subspace|basis of subspace]]. 

We know that $\mathcal{B} = \{(a,b)|a,b\in\mathbb{R},a<b\}$ is a basis for $\mathbb{R}$. Then the basis for subspace $[1,2]$ is 
$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathcal{B}_{[1,2]} &= \{[1,2]\cap(a,b)|a,b\in\mathbb{R},a<b\}\\
&= \{(a,b)|1\leq a < b\leq 2\}\cup\{[a,b)|1<b\leq2\}\cup\{(a,b]|1\leq a<2\}\cup\{[1,2]\}
\end{aligned}
$$
is a basis for subspace $[1,2]$.

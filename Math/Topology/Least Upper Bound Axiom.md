*Definition:* Let $S$ be any set of real numbers. If $\exists b\in S$ such that $\forall x\in S ,x\leq b$, $b$ is said to be the greatest element of $S$.
The smallest element of $S$ can be defined in a similar manner.

*Definiton:* Let $S$ be any set of real numbers. If $\exists c$ such that $\forall x\in S$, $x\leq c$, $c$ is said to be the upper bound of $S$.
The lower bound of $S$ can be defined in a similar manner.

*Least Upper Bound Axiom:* Let $S$ be a non-empty set of real numbers. If $S$ has an upper bound, then it has a least upper bound.
Similar axiom for largest lower bound exists.


*Lemma:* Let $S$ be a subset of $\mathbb{R}$ which is bounded from above and let $p$ be the supremum of $S$. If $S$ is a closed set of $\mathbb{R}$, then $p\in S$.

*Proof:* Suppose $p\in \mathbb{R}\backslash S$. Then there exists real numbers $a,b$ such that $p\in(a,b)\subseteq \mathbb{R}\backslash S$. Since $p$ is the least upper bound of $S$ and $a<p$ there exists $x\in S$ such that $a < x <p$. Therefore, $x\in(a,b)\subseteq  \mathbb{R}\backslash S$ which is a contradiction. Hence our supposition is wrong.

*Proposition:* Let $(X,\tau)$ and $(Y,\tau')$ be topological spaces. Let $f:X\rightarrow Y$. $f$ is a [[Homeomorphism|homeomorphism]] if and only if:
(i) $f$ is [[Continuous functions|continuous]],
(ii) $f$ is [[Injective, Surjective and Bijective|bijective]], such that $f^{-1}$ exists, and
(iii) $f^{-1}$ is continuous

*Proof:* Assume $f$ is homeomorphism. Then $f$ is bijective. Furthermore, $\forall U\in\tau, f(U)\in\tau'$ and $\forall V\in\tau',f^{-1}(V)\in'\tau$. Therefore $f$ and $f^{-1}$ are continuous.

Assume (i), (ii) and (iii) are true. Then $f$ is clearly a homeomorphism.

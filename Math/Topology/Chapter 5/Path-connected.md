*Definition:* A topological space $(X,\tau)$ is said to be **path-connected** (or **pathwise connected**) if for each pair of (distinct) points $a$ and $b$ of $X$ there exists a [[Continuous functions|continuous]] map $f:[0,1]\rightarrow (X,\tau)$, such that $f(0)=a$ and $f(1) = b$. The map $f$ is said to be a **path joining a to b**.



Example 1: Every interval is path connected.

Example 2: For $n\geq 1$, $\mathbb{R}^n$ is path connected.

*Definitons:* Let $f$ be a function from a set $X$ to $Y$.
1. The function $f$ is said to be **injective** if $f(x_1) = f(x_2)\implies x_1=x_2$.
2. The function $f$ is said to be **surjective** if for each $y\in Y$ there exists an $x\in X$ such that $f(x) = y$.
3. The function $f$ is said to be **bijective** if it is injective and surjective.

*Remark:* Injective functions means that the function takes one elements from $X$ to $Y$. Furthermore, no two elements from $X$ gets mapped to the same element from $Y$. Bijective functions ensure that all the elements of $Y$ get mapped to from the elements of $X$. If there are less elements in $X$ than in $Y$ then one element of $Y$ can get mapped to multiple elements from $X$. Bijective functions can only exists if $X$ and $Y$ have the same size.

*Remark:* A function $f:X\mapsto Y$ will always take all elements from $X$ and map them to elements of $Y$.

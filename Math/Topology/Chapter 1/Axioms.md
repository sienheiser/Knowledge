#Topology
Let $X$ be a non empty set. A set $\tau$ is said to be a **topology** on $X$ if 
1. $X$ and $\emptyset$ belong to $\tau$
2. the union of any (finite or infinite) number of sets in $\tau$ belong to $tau$, and
3. the intersection between any two sets in $\tau$ belong to $\tau$.

The pair ($X,\tau$) is called a **topological space**.

*Remark:* We now have the definiton of a what a topology and a topological space is. If we are given a topological space $(X,\tau)$ where the set $X$ is finite and small then we may use the above definiton to check if $\tau$
satisfies all those conditions. But it becomes next to impossible once $X$ becomes big.

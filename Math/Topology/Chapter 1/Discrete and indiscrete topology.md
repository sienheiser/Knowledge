*Definiton:* Let $X$ be a non-empty set and $\tau$ the collection of all subsets of $X$. Then $\tau$ is called a **discrete [[Axioms|topology]]** on $X$. The pair $(X,\tau)$ is called a **discrete space**.

*Definiton:* Let $X$ be a non-empty set and $\tau = \{X,\emptyset\}$. Then $\tau$ is called an **indiscrete [[Axioms|topology]]** on $X$. The pair $(X,\tau)$ is a called an **indiscrete space**.

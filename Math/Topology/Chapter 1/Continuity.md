Suppose we have two sets $M$ and $N$ who have topologies $\mathcal{O}_{\mathcal{M}}$ and $\mathcal{O}_{\mathcal{N}}$ respectively. Let $f$ be a map from $f:M\rightarrow N$. Then $f$ is continuos if for every [[Open and Closed sets|open set]] $V \in \mathcal{O}_{\mathcal{N}}$ the [[Image and Preimage| preimage]] of $V$ w.r.t to $f$ is an open set  in $\in \mathcal{O}_{\mathcal{M}}$.

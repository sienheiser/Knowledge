A topological space $(M,\mathcal{O})$ is called a $d$-dimensional topological manifold if for all $p$ belonging to $M$ there exists an openset $U$ which contains $p$ and there exists a map $x$ such that 
$$
U \rightarrow x(U)\subseteq \mathbb{R}^d
$$
and the map must satisfy the following conditions
(i). $x$ is invertible $x^{-1}:x\rightarrow U$
(ii). $x$ is continous
(iii). $x^{-1}$ is continuous  


*Remarks* $U$ is an openset w.r.t $\mathcal{O}$. For condition (ii). $M$ has topology $\mathcal{O}$ and $\mathbb{R}^d$ had the standard topology.

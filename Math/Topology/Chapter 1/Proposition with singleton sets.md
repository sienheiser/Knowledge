*Proposition*: If $(X,\tau)$ is a [[Axioms|topological space]] such that, for every $x\in X$, the singleton set $\{x\}$ is in $\tau$. Then $\tau$ is a [[Discrete and indiscrete topology|discrete topology]].


*Proof*: Take any subset  of $X$. Let's call it $S$. Now $S$ can be decomposed into the union of singleton sets 
$$
S = \bigcup_{i\in I} \{x_i\}
$$
where $I$ is an index set. But this means that $S$ must belong to $\tau$ since $\tau$ is a [[Axioms|topology]] on $X$. Since any subset of $X$ belongs to $\tau$ then $\tau$ is a [[Discrete and indiscrete topology|discrete topology]] on $X$.

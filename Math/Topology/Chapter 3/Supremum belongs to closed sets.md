*Lemma:* Let $S$ be a subset of $\mathbb{R}$ which is bounded from above and let $p$ be the supremum of $S$. If $S$ is a [[Open and Closed sets|closed set]] then $P\in S$.

*Proof:* Let $p\in\mathbb{R}\backslash S$. Since $S$ is bounded from above $\text{max}(S)<p$. Since $\mathbb{R}\backslash S$ is an open set, there $\exists a,b\in\mathbb{R}:p\in(a,b)\subseteq \mathbb{R}\backslash S$. Since $p$ is the least upper bound of $S$ and $a<p$ there exists an $a$ such that $a<\text{max}(S)<p$. Therefore $\text{max}(S)\in\mathbb{R}\backslash S$.  But this is a contradiction. Therefore our supposition is false. Hence $p\in S$.

*Remark:* In this proof there is an additional assumption of the existence of an $a\in\mathbb{R}\backslash S$ such that $a<\text{max}(S)$. We may need to prove this. #ToBeProven

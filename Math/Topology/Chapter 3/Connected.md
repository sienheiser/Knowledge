*Definition:* Let $(X,\tau)$ be a [[Axioms|topological space]]. Then it is said to be connected if the only clopen subsets of $X$ are $X$ and $\emptyset$.

*Remark:* By proposition [[Clopen sets of euclidean topology on real numbers]] the [[The Euclidean Topology on Real numbers|euclidean topology on real numbers]] is connected.

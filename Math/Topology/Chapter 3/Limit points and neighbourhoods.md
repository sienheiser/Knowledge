*Proposition:* Let $A$ be a subset of [[Axioms|topological space]] $(X,\tau)$. A point $x$ is a [[Limit points|limit point]] of $A$ if and only if every [[Neighbourhood|neighbourhood]] of $x$ contains a point $A$ different from $x$.

*Proof:* Assume $x$ is a limit point of $A$. Then every open subset that contains $x$ must contains a point of $A$ different from $x$. Suppose $N$ is any neighbourhood of $x$. Then there exists an open subset $U$ such that $x\in U\subseteq N$. Since every open subset contains a point of $A$ different from $x$ the same is true for every neighbourhood of $N$.

Assume that every neighbourhood of $x$ contains a point of $A$ different from $x$. Since every open set is a neighbourhood of $x$, by assumption, every open set must contain a point of $A$ different from $x$.

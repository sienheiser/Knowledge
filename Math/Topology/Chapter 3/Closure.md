*Definiton:* Let $A$ be a subset of [[Axioms|topological space]] $(X,\tau)$. Then the set $A\cup A'$ consisting of $A$ and all its limit points is called the closure of $A$ and is denoted $\bar{A}$.

To find the closure of a set. Simply find all its limit points and add those limit points to the original set.

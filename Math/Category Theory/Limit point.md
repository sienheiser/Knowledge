The  above figure shows four different categories: $I,C,[C,I]$ and Cones. The categories $[C,I]$ and Cones can be derived from the index categories $I$ and $C$ and the diagrams (functors) between them. The red arrows denote natural transformations and the dotted arrows denote unique morphism between two objects.

If we start with categories $I$ and $C$ we can map the two objects in $I$ using diagrams $D:I\rightarrow C$, $F:I\rightarrow C$, $\Delta_a: I\rightarrow C$ and $\Delta_c :I\rightarrow C$.

We can construct category $[C,I]$ by viewing functors as objects and natural transformations as morphisms between them. By  looking at the red arrows in $C$, we see that red arrows $\alpha_i$ and $\alpha_j$  in $C$ become $\alpha$ in $[C,I]$, same happens for $\beta$ and $\gamma$.

We can construct category Cones by looking at the unique morphisms in $C$. So we have three objects in Cones because there are three cones in $C$ two share the same base.

The category $C$ in the figure does not have a limit point because in the Cones view there is no terminal object. If there was a unique morphism from $\Delta_c \rightarrow \Delta_b$ then $\Delta_b$ would be a terminal object and $C$ would have a Limit point.

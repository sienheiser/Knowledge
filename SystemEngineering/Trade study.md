A trade study is essentially a list of different possible paths that can be taken to break down a problem. In the initial stages of a project we would need to do a trade study between different high-levels options that can be taken. 

Once a list of options is made, there are few mains ways a choice can be made:
1. Using engineering experience
2. Using models, whether they be physical or mathematical in nature.

Once a choice is made then another trade study needs to be on the next choice. This keeps happening until we reach a solution. 

*Remark:* If we used a mathematical model to model the system, then after each trade study we would improve the model and it could be used as a sort of system verification.

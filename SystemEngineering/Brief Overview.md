If we have a very complicated problem that cannot be solved in one go then we need to break it down into simpler components. There are three main groups a system engineer needs to deal with:
1. The stakeholders (customers)
2. The project manager: cares about budget and schedualing
3. The experts: where the requirement we make still gives them room to be flexible.
The system engineer needs to find a balance between the needs of these three entities.

Since a problem might be complex. It is not possible possible to break it down into its smallest components intially. We may break down a problem into its highlevel components, then further break down those high level components into mid level components and finally break down the mid level components into low level components.

Many times when attempting to break a complex problem, you will be able to take multiple paths. Many of these paths would not be a viable solution. Maybe there would only one path that gives the best solution. But what we want to find is a path the gives a solution for the problem.

The figure shows such a situation. The orange path show the best possible solution, but we see that paths that end with the green circle are also viable solution. 

It is not feasible to explore all the paths therefore we have to make a decision using something called a [[Trade study|trade study]].

## About Me
I enjoy working in a place that gives me the opportunity to work on different **things**. I take pride that I am open-minded and flexible with the problems I deal with. I am a curious person with an interest in fundamental questions and underlying logic.


## Education
Master Degree in Theoretical Physics from Lund University, Sweden (2020-2022). Extent 120 ECTS credits whereof 60 ECTS credits Master Degree Project. I received the highest grade for seven out of eight courses and my Master Degree Project.

Bachelor Degree in Theoretical Physics from Lund University, Sweden (2017-2020). Extent 180 ECTS credits whereof 15 ECTS credits Bachelor Degree Project. I received the highest grade for half of the courses and my Bachelor Degree Project.

## Work Experience
## Coding
I came onto the job as a technical writer. We were going to start a big testing phase which required many test specifications for different systems. I wrote scripts that helped with generating test generation https://gitlab.esss.lu.se/emmanueldcosta/specification-generator

When I initially started scripting documents I had to write code in VBA. VBA is not compatible with GIT which made version control difficult. My colleague and I were able to find a work around that allows us to use python instead https://gitlab.esss.lu.se/emmanueldcosta/pyword 

I had gathered relevant data for our team into a database. I decided to build a website to allow our team to view useful data https://gitlab.esss.lu.se/emmanueldcosta/pyword 

I learnt how to build EPICS IOCs, I mainly write scripts to generate EPICS code and operator interfaces (OPIs).

## Testing
### Crate testing
Our team had manufactured crates and I was tasked with checking if they were built according to the electrical drawings. The main challenge was tracking the small discrepancies between the electrical drawings and the crates. The process used to make sure these issues were addressed by creating jira tickets and adding photos of the discrepancies and writing text to provide context.

### Firmware testing
We use a tester developed in-house to test firmware. The main challenge is finding out why a test fails. I used debugging tools to look at what happens step by step and isolate where the test was failing. Then I build hypotheses as to why such a failure and try fixing it.


## Programming 
1. Python: I am very comfortable and experienced in using Python to develop algorithms and analyse data. 
2. Haskell: I have basic knowledge of Haskell.
3. SQL: I can build SQL databases and query them.
4. VHDL: I can build testbenches in VHDL to test entities or packages.
5. GitHub: I am experienced in using GitHub for version control.

## Languages
My first language is English. I also speak intermediate Romanian and basic Hindi and Swedish. I am currently learning Swedish.

## Extracurricular Activites
In my free time I am learning a new programming language called Haskell. I like to program animation videos. Currently, I like to row and boulder.

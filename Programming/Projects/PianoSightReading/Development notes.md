I want exploring what formats can I record a lesson. A lesson has the following parameters I want to keep track
1. The notes displayed in the lesson
2. The notes pressed in each lesson
3. The time it takes to press each note
I have implemented the above. Right now I have a basic way of randomly choosing displaying three notes on the piano and starting the specified information in an sqlite3 database.

The next question is working on the randomly choosing of three notes to display. **I believe** this aspect is the crux of this app. These are the impressions I have 
1. I need something that will look on the generate lessons given a some keys as input. So for example I need a model that can generate music notes that sound nice.


I am still lost on how to approach this problem of generating reasonably sounding music notes.

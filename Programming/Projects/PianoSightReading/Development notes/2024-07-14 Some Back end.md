Today I will continue coding the back end logic. I will continue trying to implement idea 2 from [[2024-07-13 Back end logic]].

What have I done today? 
1. Using sqlalchemy, I created a database model of the tables that should exist in sqlite database.
2. Created function in main.py that update the $ith$ table in the database by adding the lesson id the key appeared in and the time it took to press the note.
3. Created function to update the lesson table.

I still feel that the way the code is arranged is sketchy. I guess it is because I have a lot of things going on in the main.py. I will try refactoring the code

## Idea
We want to design an application that helps a student get better at piano sight reading.

## Concept
The application shall do the following
1. It shall provide lessons to the pupil. 
2. It shall track how well the pupil completes the lesson.
3. Based on the previous lesson the application shall give the pupil another lesson.

## Break down of application
The application shall be broken down into the following bits
1. **The expert**: a model of the ideal state that a student could reach.
2. **The learner**: a model of a student's state.
3. **The tutor**: a algorithm that determines what to show to the student. Its goal is to optimize the lessons such that a student reaches state of expert in the shortest time.
4. **The interface**: shows how the learning experience is progressing

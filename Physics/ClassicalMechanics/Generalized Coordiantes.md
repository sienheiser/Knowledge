Definition: Any $s$ quantities $q_1,....,q_s$ which completely completely define the position of a system with $s$ [[Degrees of Freedom]].

Note: We can then define generalized velocities which are just $\dot{q_i} = \frac{\text{d}q_i}{\text{d}t}$. 

#### Some thoughts

If we can determine the [[Degrees of Freedom]] of a system. Then we immediately know how many generalized coordinates are needed.

#### Important 
If  all the $q_1,....,q_s$ and $\dot{q}_1,....,\dot{q}_s$ are specified at a certain point. Only then can the path the system takes be specified completely.

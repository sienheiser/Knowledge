According to [[Disintegration of two particle (lab frame)|disintegration of two particles (lab frame)]] we can compute the velocites of two particles if we know the initial particles mass and the masses of the two particles after disintegration. 

Usually we stand in the lab frame and the initial particle is moving w.r.t to our frame. To obtain velocity relations of the particles after disintegration between the two frames. We may use the identity from [[Galileo's Relativity Principle#Galilean coordinate transformation between two frames]]. If the initial particle is moving with veloctiy $\vec{V}$ w.r.t us then the velocity of one of the particles after disintegration is given by 
$$
\vec{v}_1 = \vec{v}_{01} + \vec{V}
$$
where $\vec{v}_1$ is the velocity of particle 1 in the lab frame, $\vec{v}_{01}$ is the velocity of particle 1 in the center of mass frame and $\vec{V}$ is the velocity of the center of mass frame w.r.t the lab frame. 

Since we are standing in the lab frame we are able to measure the speed of the particles after disintegration. Using that speed we may find the speed of the particles after disintegration in the center of mass frame by

$$
v_{01}^2 = v_1^2- v_1 V\cos(\theta)  + V^2,
$$
where $\theta$ is the angle between $\vec{v}_1$ and $\vec{V}$.

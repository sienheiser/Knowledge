A frame of reference can always be chosen in which space is homogenous and isotropic while time is homogenous. This frame is known as an intertial frame.  If space was not homogenous this would mean that if we left a particle a one point then the particle would start moving. 

### The form of Lagrangian of a free paritcle

We can deduce some properties that the $\mathcal{L}$ of a free paritcle must have. The homogenaity of space implies that the $\mathcal{L}$ must not depend on radius vector $\textbf{r}$. Next, the isotropicity of space implies that the direction which we depend on does not affect $\mathcal{L}$. Meaning the $\mathcal{L}$ only depends on magnitude of velocity. So $\mathcal{L} = \mathcal{L}(v^2)$. With this we can use the EL-equations to get 
$$
\frac{\partial\mathcal{L}}{\partial \vec{r}} = 0 \implies \frac{\text{d}}{\text{d}t}\frac{\partial\mathcal{L}}{\partial \vec{v}} = 0 \implies \frac{\partial\mathcal{L}}{\partial \vec{v}} = \text{constant}.
$$

### The Law of Inertia
*Definition*: In an iniertial frame any free motion takes place with a velocity that is constant in magnitude and direction.

### Galileo's Relativity Principle
*Definition*: In all intertial frames the properties of space and time are the same.

### Galilean coordinate transformation between two frames

Suppose we have two frames $K$ and $K^`$. Let $K^`$ move with velocity $\textbf{V}$ to the right w.r.t to $K$. Imagine we are at the origin of frame $K$. Suppose we view the frame with time axis vertical and spatial axis horizontal. Then the path that is traced by $K^`$ in $K$ is 

$$
\textbf{r} = \textbf{r}^{`} + \textbf{V}t^` 
$$

and the relation between time in the two frames is $t=t^`$. These relations relate the [[coordinate curves]] between the two frames. So we have the following relation 

$$
t = t^`\\,\text{      
}
\textbf{r} = \textbf{r}^{`} + \textbf{V}t^` .
$$

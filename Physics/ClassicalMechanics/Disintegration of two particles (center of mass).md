Suppose we view a particle in its [[Center of Mass (classical mechanics)|center of mass]] reference frame. Imagine that the particle explodes into two other particles, with momentum $\vec{p}_1$ and $\vec{p}_2$. According to [[Momentum (Classical mechanics)|momentum conservation]] the following is true 
$$
\vec{p}_1+\vec{p}_2 = \vec{0} \implies \vec{p}_1 = - \vec{p}_2.
$$

According to [[Energy|energy]] conservation the following is true

$$
E_{i} = E_{i1}+E_{i2}+\frac{p_1^2}{2m_1}+\frac{p_2^2}{2m_2}
$$
where $E_{i}$ is the internal energy of the initial particle, $E_{i1}$ and $E_{i2}$ are the internal energies of particles 1 and 2 respectively. The terms $\frac{p_1^2}{2m_1}$ and $\frac{p_2^2}{2m_2}$ are the kinectic energies of particles 1 and 2 respectively. Suppose we know the internal energies of all the particles then using momentum conservation and energy conservation we can find the velocites of each particle by 

$$
\epsilon = E_{i} - E_{i1}-E_{i2} =\frac{p_1^2}{2} \left(\frac{1}{m_1}+\frac{1}{m_2}\right) = \frac{p_1^2}{2} \mu.
$$
This implies
$$
\frac{2\epsilon}{\mu m_1^2} = v_1^2,\quad \frac{2\epsilon}{\mu m_2^2} = v_2^2.
$$

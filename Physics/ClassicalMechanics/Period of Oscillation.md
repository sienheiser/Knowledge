aliases: [period of oscillation]

#ClassicalMechanics 

If a system is bounded in 1D then it has an oscillation behaviour. The period of this oscillation can be calculated using the integral in [[Motion in One Dimension|motion in one dimension]]. Suppose it take time $t$ for the object to go from point $x_1$ to $x_2$. Then the period is just $2t$, since it must take the same time to return to the original point (***Why is this??????***). Therefore
$$
T = 2t\implies T = \sqrt{2m}\int_{x_1(E)}^{x_2(E)} \frac{dx}{\sqrt{E-U(x)}}
$$
$x_1$ and $x_2$ are roots of the equation $E = U(x)$.

Definition: The number of independent quantities that must be specified in order to define uniquely the position of any system is called the number of degrees of freedom.

#### Explanation 1
Imagine a free particle moving through space. This particle can move in the x,y,z direction. To fully define this system we need three quantities, i.e. three degrees of freedom.

Next imagine a particle that follows the following path in a Cartesian system
$$
\textbf{r} = [\cos(t),\sin(t),t].
$$

This system only has one degree of freedom. 

Suppose a particle is constraint to move on a 2D surface. Then to fully describe that system we need two degrees of freedom.

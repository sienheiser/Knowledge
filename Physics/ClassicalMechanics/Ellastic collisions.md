#ClassicalMechanics 

*Definition*: When two bodies interact but their internal state does not change. Due to momentum conservation we have that the two particles after interaction must have momentum that is equal and opposite. Since no internal state of the bodies is changed; due to energy conservation the magnitudes of velocity before and after interaction are the same.

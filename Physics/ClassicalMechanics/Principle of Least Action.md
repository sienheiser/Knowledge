**Definition**: Every mechanical system is charactrized by a definite function $\mathcal{L}(q_1,..,q_s,\dot{q}_1,...,\dot{q}_s)$ or briefly $\mathcal{L}(q,\dot{q})$ where $q_i$ are [[Generalized Coordiantes|generalized coordinates]]. The motion of the system is such that a certain condition is satisfied.



**Condition**: Let the system occupy positions at instants $t_1$ and $t_2$ with sets of coordiantes $q^{(1)}$ and $q^{(2)}$. Then the system moves in such a way that the quantity
$$S = \int^{t_2}_{t_1}\mathcal{L}(q,\dot{q})dt$$
takes the least possible value.

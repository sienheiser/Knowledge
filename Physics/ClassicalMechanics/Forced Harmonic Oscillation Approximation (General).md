In [[Harmonic Approximation General|harmonic approximation general]] we were able to find a new set of coordinates that satisfied independent equation of motions (equation (9)). From the equations of motion we know the Lagrangian has form
$$
\mathcal{L} = \sum_i \frac{1}{2}m_i(\Theta_i^2+\omega_i^2 \Theta_i^2). \tag{1}
$$

We may define a new set of coordiantes as $\mathcal{Q}_i = \sqrt{m_i}\Theta_i$ giving Lagrangian

$$
\mathcal{L} = \sum_i \frac{1}{2}(\mathcal{Q}_i^2+\omega_i^2\mathcal{Q}_i^2) \tag{2}
$$

Using what was done in [[Forced Harmonic Oscillations Approximation]] we know the Lagrangian in the general case looks like

$$
\mathcal{L} = \frac{1}{2}\sum_{i,j} m_ij\dot{q}_i\dot{q}_j + k_ij q_iq_j + \sum_k q_kF_k(t)  \tag{3} 
$$

Using equation (8) in [[Harmonic Approximation General]] we get

$$
\mathcal{L} = \sum_i \frac{1}{2}(\dot{\mathcal{Q}}_i^2 + \mathcal{Q}_i)+f_i(t)\mathcal{Q}_i  \tag{3}
$$

where $f_i = \sum_k \frac{F_k(t)\Delta_{ik}}{\sqrt{m_i}}$.

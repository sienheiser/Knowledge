We have looked situation when one partilce disintegrates into two particles in [[Disintegration of two particles (center of mass)|disintegration of two particles (center of mass)]]. However, in realisitic situations one particle will usually disintigrate in many other particles. We are interested in the distributions of the particles. To obtain useful expressions we assume that the particles are distributed isotropically. 

Suppose we are in the center of mass frame ($C$ frame) for a particle that disintigrates in $N$ other particles. Since we are in the $C$ frame all the particles have the same energy and are isotropically distributed. Imagine a sphere with the disintegrating particle at its center. Eventually, $N$ particles will pass through the sphere. It is clear that a the number particles passing through a portion of the sphere is directly proportional to the [[Solid Angles|solid angle]] considered. If $N\propto 4\pi$ then $x\propto 2\pi\sin\theta_0 d\theta_0$ where $x$ is not a known number of particles, $\theta_0$ is the angle defined in [[Velocity In Two Different Frames|velocity in two frames]] and  $2\pi\sin\theta_0$ is the infinitesimal solid angle $d\Omega$. Then we obtain

$$
\frac{x}{N} = \frac{1}{2}\sin\theta_0d\theta_0
$$
where $x/N$ can be viewed as the fraction of particles entering the solid angle. The above formula is the distribution of particle in $C$ frame. 

To find the corresponding distribution in the lab frame we need to use a transformation. We knoe from [[Disintegration of two particle (lab frame)|disintegration of two particles (lab frame)]] that $\vec{v} = \vec{v}_0+\vec{V}$. The vectors $\vec{v}, \vec{v}_0$ and $\vec{V}$ are defined in [[Velocity In Two Different Frames|veloctity in two frames]]. Then

$$
v^2 = v_0^2+V^2+2v_0V\cos\theta_0
$$

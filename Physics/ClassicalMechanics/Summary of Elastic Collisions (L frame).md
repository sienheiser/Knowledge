We started by considering the system in L frame and giving two particles initial velocites $\vec{v}_1$ and $\vec{v}_2$. Then we found the velocities in the CM frame by using the scheme in [[Two-Body problem reduction|two body problem reduction]]. After that using momentum conservation and energy conservation due to elastic collisions we obtained velocites of the particles after they collide in the CM frame. Using Galileon transformation we obtain the velocities in the L frame.  

$$
\vec{v}_i' = \vec{v}_{0i}' + \vec{V} 
$$

Then we rewrite the above equations in terms of momentum and represented the eqautions geometrically see [[Elastic Collisions (L frame)]]. This is the set up of the problem after that it is just algebraic manipulations.  The most important thing to take away from the elastic collisions part is the fact that we start in the*** L frame then move to C frame where we use momentum conservation and energy conservation to get the velocites of the particles after collision, then we finally transform back to the L frame and write the final velocites in terms of the velocities in the C frame and center of mass velocity.***

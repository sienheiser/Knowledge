Suppose we are in lab frame and we see two particles that are going to collide [[Ellastic collisions|ellastically]] with initial velocites $\vec{v}_1$ and $\vec{v}_2$. Then in the center of mass frame we may write the their velocites as 
$$
\vec{v}_{01} = \frac{m_2  \vec{v} }{m_1+m_2}, \quad \vec{v}_{02} = -\frac{m_1\vec{v}}{m_1+m_2}
$$
using the scheme used in [[Two-Body problem reduction|two-body problem reduction]]. Where we define $\vec{v} = \vec{v}_1-\vec{v}_2$. Due to momentum conservation the velocities after collisons must be opposite in direction. Due energy conservation the magniutdes $v_1 = v_1'$ and $v_2 = v_2'$. This gives
$$
\vec{v}_{01}' = \frac{m_2 v}{m_1+m_2} \hat{n};\quad \vec{v}_{02}' = -\frac{m_1 v}{m_1+m_2} \hat{n}
$$
where $\hat{n}$ is a unit vector pointing in the direction after collision. Nothing more can be said about the system.

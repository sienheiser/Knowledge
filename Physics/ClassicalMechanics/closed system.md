### closed system (classical mechancis)

In nonrelativestic mechanics a closed system is a system that does not exchange any matter with its surrounding. It isn't subjected to any external forces other than the forces in the system

*comments*: In Lagrangian mechanics even if the entire system under the influence of an external force. As long as the force is static there is still conservation.

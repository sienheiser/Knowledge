We can infer a few more properties between the lab frame and center of mass frame. In [[Disintegration of two particle (lab frame)|disintegration of two particles (lab frame)]] we found the relations of velocities between the two frames. 

Suppose we make a circle with radius $v_{10}$ (velocity of particle 1 after disnintegration in center of mass frame). Then we can make the following diagram.

Let $f$ be a quantity that is related to a macroscopic body or part of it. Even if the system is in [[Statistical equlibrium|statistical equilibrium]], the system will still fluctuate from the mean value momenterily. To capture this deviation we could define a quantity as 

$$\Delta f = f-\bar{f}.$$

However, the mean of such a quantity is zero, since the system will fluctuate backwards and forwards making $\Delta f$ postive and negative respectively. As a result $\Delta f$ has mean zero. A better quantity is to look at $\sqrt{\overline{\Delta f^2}}$ called the root mean squared fluctuation of $f$ (or standard deviation).  We rewrite
$$
\overline{\Delta f^2} = \overline{f^2-2f\bar{f}+\bar{f}^2} = \overline{f^2}-2\bar{f}\bar{f}+\bar{f}^2 = \overline{f^2}-\bar{f}^2.
$$
The above quantity is also called the variance. Since $\sqrt{\overline{\Delta f^2}}$ is a measure of how much the system fluctuates away from it mean. If we divide the standard deviation by its mean
$$
\frac{\sqrt(\overline{\Delta f^2})}{\bar{f}}
$$
we get the quantity called relative fluctuations.

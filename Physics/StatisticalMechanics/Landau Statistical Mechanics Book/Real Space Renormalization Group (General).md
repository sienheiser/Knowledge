Suppose a system has parameters
$$
\vec{K} = (K_1,...,K_N).
$$ 
After renormalization the system transform as
$$
\vec{K}^{(n)} = \vec{R}(\vec{K}^{(n-1)})
$$
and 
$$
r^{(n)} = \frac{r^{(n-1)}}{b},
$$
which is similar for the correlation length. At critical points the following is true
$$
\vec{K}^* = \vec{R}(\vec{K}^*).
$$
and 
$$
\xi^* = \frac{\xi^*}{b}.
$$
If $b = 1$ then all is good. If $b\neq 1$ then $\xi^*$ is either zero (called trivial fixed point) or infinite (called critical fixed point). The trivial fixed point is where the system is at zero temperature or infinite temperature. The critical fixed point is where the system is at the critical temperature.

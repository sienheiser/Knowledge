In [[Louville's theorem]] we saw that the statistical distribution function $\mathcal{Q}$ is constant along phase trajectories  as the subsystem moves as a [[closed system|closed system]]. Meaning that  $\mathcal{Q}$  can be expressed in terms of $q$ and $p$. These combinations of $q$ and $p$ are known as [[Integrals of the motion|integrals of the motion]].

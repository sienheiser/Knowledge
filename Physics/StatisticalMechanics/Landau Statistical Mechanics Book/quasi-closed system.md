Suppose we have a large system with many macroscopic [[Subsystems|subsystems]].  If we take a look at one subsystem. Most of the subsystems particles are inside it compared to its boundaries. If we look at this subsystem for a short period of time, most of the interactions occur within the subsystem compared to boundaries. This means over a short period of time the subsystem is ***quasi-closed***. However, if we look the subsystem for longer periods of time then the interactions at the boundaries however weak need taken into account. Over long periods of time it is these **weak interactions that allow the system in statistical equilibrium**.]

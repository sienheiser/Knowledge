The correlation function is a measure of how often two random variables have the same value. Suppose the function $N(x)$ is a random function. Then we want to find the correlation between $N(x)$ and $N(x+a)$. We can define a correlation function as 
$$
C = \frac{\langle [N(x)-N(x+a)]^2\rangle}{2\langle N(x) \rangle^2}.
$$
The factor in the denominator can be viewed as a normalization function.

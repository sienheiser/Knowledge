This is the idea that if we have a system with critical temperature $T_c$ and there exist some non zero correlation length in the system. Then, if the system has temperture $T<T_c$ as we renormalize to larger scales the system temperature as a whole decreses going farther away from $T_c$. On the filp side, if $T>T_c$ going to larger scales increases the temperature of the system. However, if the system starts at the critical temperature $T_c$, after renormalization the system remains at the same point. This is true regardless of the number times renormaliztion is applied. Such a point is called [[Fixed Point|fixed point]]

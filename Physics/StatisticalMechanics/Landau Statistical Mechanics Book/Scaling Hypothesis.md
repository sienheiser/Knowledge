[[Scale Invariance|Scale invariance]] has been defined. The scaling hypothesis is that the following functions are scale invariant at the critical point

$$
t' = b^{y_t}t
$$
$$
\mathcal{h}' = b^{y_\mathcal{h}}\mathcal{h}
$$
$$
\mathcal{f}' = b^{y_f}f
$$
where $t = (T-T_c)/T_c$ is the reduced temperature, $f = F/L^d$ and $\mathcal{h} = \beta h$

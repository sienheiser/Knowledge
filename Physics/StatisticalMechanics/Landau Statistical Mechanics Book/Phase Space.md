Suppose a system has $s$ [[Degrees of Freedom|degrees of freedom]]. This means that $q_1,....,q_s$ [[Generalized Coordiantes|generalized coordinates]] are needed to describe the system. From the generalized coordinates the generalized momenta $p_1,....,p_s$ can be defined. In the phase space each generalized coordinate and generalize momentum has its own axis. This means that each point in the phase space (usually called phase point) is a physical realization of the system. The path a system takes through the phase space is called a phase trajectory

### example of phase space

The simplest phase space is that of a single particle moving along the $x$ axis in physical space. It can be described by the $x$ coordinate (which is the generalized coordinate) and the momentum $p=mx$. The figure above depicts two types of phase trajectories. The left plot depicts a free particle moving with constant velocity. The right plot depicts a particle that starts accelerating when it reaches $x_0$ and deaccelerating when it reaches $x_1$. 

So for a system with one degree of freedom the phase space is two dimensional. Meaning a system with $s$ degrees of freedom is $2s$ dimensional.

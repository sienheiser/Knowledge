Suppose we have function $G$ at a [[Fixed Point|fixed point]] that describes some part of the system. For expample the correlation length. Then after [[Real Space Renormalization Group Part 1|renormalization]] is applied to the system and we scale out we get function $G'$. If 

$$
G' = b^kG
$$

where $b$ is the constant we rescale with after renormalizing the system. The power $k$ is known as the critical index and can be any integer.

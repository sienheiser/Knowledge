In [[Real Space Renormalization Group Part 1]] we derived the expression relating the parameter $K^{(n)}$ to the old parameters $K^{(0)}$ and $L^{(0)}$. The relations we get 
$$
K^{(n)} = R (K^{(n-1)}).
$$
Furthermore, we have obtained how to scale length after every applications of renormalization. The relation for the [[Correlation Length|correlation length]] is 
$$
\xi^{(n)} = \frac{\xi^{(n-1)}}{b}
$$
where $b$ is the scale factor.

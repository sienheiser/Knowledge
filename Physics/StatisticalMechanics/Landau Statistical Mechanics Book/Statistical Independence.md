### statistical independece
Since subsystems over short periods of time are [[quasi-closed system|quasi-closed systems]]. This mean over long period of times they are weakly interacting with other subsystems. As a result, they do not affect eachother's states, we call this property ***statistically independent***. Suppose we take two volume elements $dq^{(1)}dp^{(1)}$ and $dq^{(2)}dp^{(2)}$ from the phase spaces of two subsystems. If we regard the two subsystems as a composite system then because of statistical independence, the total volume element of the combined phase space is $dq^{(12)}dp^{(12)}=dq^{(1)}dp^{(1)}dq^{(2)}dp^{(2)}$. Furthermore the probaility that composite system is in a certain state is given as $$\mathcal{Q}^{(12)}dq^{(12)}dp^{(12)}=\mathcal{Q}^{(1)}dq^{(1)}dp^{(1)}\mathcal{Q}^{(2)}dq^{(2)}dp^{(2)}$$
or
$$
\mathcal{Q}^{(12)} = \mathcal{Q}^{(1)}\mathcal{Q}^{(2)}.
$$
The same can be said for more then two subsystems given that they are a small part of the system.


Let $f_1$ and $f_2$ be physical quantites that describe the two subsystems seperately. If we want to the mean of the composite system they describe we get
$$
\overline{f_1f_2} = \int f_1(q^{(1)},p^{(1)})f_2(q^{(2)},p^{(2)})\mathcal{Q}^{(1)}\mathcal{Q}^{(2)}dq^{(1)}dp^{(1)}dq^{(2)}dp^{(2)}=\bar{f_1}\bar{f_2}.
$$
This means that for composite systems made of statistically independent systems the mean of the composite system is the product of subsystems.

From [[Finding the statistical distribution|finding statisitcal distribution]], we know what is a statistical ensemble of a subsystem. Suppose the being decides to remove his clones and superimpose all the copies of the [[Phase Space|phase space]], making sure that the axies align. But he leaves the all the radius vectors from the copies to whatever phase point they point at (see figure above). Then if he were to let all the phase radius vectors evolve, their tips would behave as gas particles. The gas particle density would be given by the statistical distribution function $\mathcal{Q}(q,p)$. The 'gas' flow of these particles would obey the [[continuity equation ]] written as
$$
\frac{\partial \mathcal{Q}}{\partial t}+\nabla\cdot(\vec{v}\mathcal{Q}) = 0,
$$
where $\vec{v}$ is the velocity of the gas (***does this mean that it contains information about the velocity of each gas particle?***).

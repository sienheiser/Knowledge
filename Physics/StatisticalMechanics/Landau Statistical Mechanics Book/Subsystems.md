Suppose we a have system with large number of macroscopic bodies (imagine that each macroscopic body has large number of particles). Suppose that this system is a [[closed system|closed system]]. Then if we focus on one body in the entire system, then this body is called a ***subsystem***. A subsystem is not closed as it interacts with the rest of the bodies in the whole system.

Suppose we have a [[Phase Space|phase space]] for a system with $s$ degrees of freedom. Then a ***small volume element*** in the phase space is denoted as $\Delta q\Delta p =\Delta q_1,...,\Delta q_s,\Delta p_1,...,\Delta p_s$. We can take the infinitesimal limit and denote the*** infinitesimal volume element*** as $dq dp =dq_1,...,dq_s,dp_1,...,dp_s$.

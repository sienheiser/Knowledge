If a closed system is in a state such that in any macroscopic subsystem the macroscopic physical values are to a high degree of accuracy equal to their mean values (to calculate mean values see [[Statistical distribution in statical mechanics#properties of the distribution function]]). Then the system is said to be in a state of ***statictical equilibrium*** (or thermal equilibrium or thermodynamic equilibrium).

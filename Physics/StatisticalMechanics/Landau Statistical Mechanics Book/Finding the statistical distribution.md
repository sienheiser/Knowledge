#StatisticalMechanics 

Suppose there is a system and we consider the subsystem of the system. Imagine there is a being who livess the phase space of the subsystem. This being is able to measure at which phase point (see [[Phase Space|phase space]])  the subsystem is in very short time intervals. For example at first interval the being measure the subsystem to be on phase point $A_1$ then on the next interval the phase point is $A_2$ and so forth. The being keeps a record how many time each phase point occurs and does this forever. After forever, the being will get a distribution this distribution is the statistical distribution $\mathcal{Q}(q,p)$ of the system.

However, the being is impaitent. It realizes that it can create infinitely many phase spaces of the same subsystem (called a ***statistical ensemble***.). It then embeds its clones into random phase points in those phase spaces. Then it allows all  of the subsystem to evolve for a very short time, such that a quasi-closed system can be regarded as a closed system.  What being will see is that at any instant $t$ the distribution of phase space point remains the same i.e. the number of copies on phase point $A_1$ remains the same, similar for $A_2$ and so forth. This distribution is the same as before i.e. $\mathcal{Q}(q,p)$.

In this way one can find the statistical distribution for any system.

## Impressions
After watching the Veratasium video he gives the impression that the entropy of a system is a measure of how spread out the energy of the system is.

## Definition 
I will choose the definition proposed by Boltzmann
$$
S = k_b\ln \Omega
$$
where $S$ is entropy, $k_b$ is the Boltzmann constant and $\Omega$ is the number of microscopic configurations.

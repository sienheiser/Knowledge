Unitary maps are maps that preserves all structures of a Hilbert space. 
*Definiton:* Let $\mathit{H}$ and $\mathit{g}$ be seperable Hilbert spaces. Then any bijection
$$
\mathcal{U}\in\mathcal{L}(H,g)
$$
preserving the inner product i.e.
$$
\langle \mathcal{U}\psi,\mathcal{U}\psi\rangle = \langle\psi,\psi\rangle
$$
is called a unitary map.

*Remark:* If such a map exists between the two Hilbertspaces. Then these two Hilbert spaces cannot be structurely distinguised from each other by using only $+,\cdot,\langle\cdot,\cdot\rangle$. In this case the two Hilbert spaces are called unitarily equivalent.

*Remark:* By polarization formula is suffices to check whether a $\mathcal{U}\in\mathcal{L}(\mathit{H},\mathit{g})$ preserves the norms 
$$
||\mathcal{U}\psi|| = ||\psi||\quad \forall \psi\in \mathit{H}.
$$

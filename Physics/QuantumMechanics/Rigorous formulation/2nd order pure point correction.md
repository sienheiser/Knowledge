Using the [[Identity operator|identity operator]]. In the case of a pure point correction we get the following formula
$$
\theta_{n\delta}^{(2)} = -\sum_{m = 1}^{\infty}\sum_{\beta = 1}^{d(m)}\frac{|\langle e_{m\beta},We_{n\delta}\rangle|^2}{h_m-h_n}
$$

*Observe:* The first order correction to eigenvalues [[1st order eigenvalues and eigenvector]] only needs information for the $nth$ eigenvector. The second order eigenvalue defined here needs information from all the energy levels. This means for high energies relativistic effects would need to be taken into account.

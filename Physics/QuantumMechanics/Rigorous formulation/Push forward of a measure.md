This seems to ring a bell with [[Push-forward map]] in differential geometry. Suppose we have a [[Physics/QuantumMechanics/Rigorous formulation/Measure|measure space]] $(M,\sigma,\mu)$ and a [[Sigma algebra|measureable space]] $(N,\tau)$. Suppose we have map $f:M\rightarrow N$ that is a [[Measureable maps|measureable map]]. Then the so called push-forward $f_{*\mu}$ of the measure $\mu$ is 
$$
\begin{aligned}
f_{*\mu}:\tau&\rightarrow \overline{\mathbb{R}}^*_0\\
A&\mapsto f_{*\mu}(A):=\mu\circ(\text{preimg(A)}).
\end{aligned}
$$

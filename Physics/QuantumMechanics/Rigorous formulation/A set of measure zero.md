*Definiton:* Let $(M,\sigma,\mu)$ be a [[Physics/QuantumMechanics/Rigorous formulation/Measure|measure space]]. Then a set $A\in\sigma$ is called a set of measure zero (also known as a **null set**) if $\mu(A) = 0$.



*Terminology:* A condition e.g. equality or convergence or ... is said to hold *almost everywhere* if it holds $\forall m\in(M\backslash N)$ where $N$ is a null set.

***Lemma 1:*** Let $A$ be an operator. Then $A\subseteq A^{**}$ where $A^{**}$  is [[Closeable, Closure and Closed|closure]]. 
*Proof: * 


***Corollary:*** If $A$ is a [[Symmetric operator|symmetric]] operator then $\overline{A}$ is also symmetric.
*Proof:*

***Theorems:*** If $A$ is a [[Physics/QuantumMechanics/Rigorous formulation/Dense|densely]] defined operator then
1. $A^*$ is already closed
2. If $A$ is bijective then  $(A^{-1})^* = (A^*)^{-1}$
3. If $A$ is bijective [[Closeable, Closure and Closed|closable]] and $\overline{A}$ is injective then $\overline{(A^{-1})} = \overline{A}^{-1}$.

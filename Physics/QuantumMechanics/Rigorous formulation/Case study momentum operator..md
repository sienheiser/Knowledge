We will learn how to construct operators. For now let's suppose we are given the momentum operator for 1D.
$$
\begin{aligned}
P:\mathcal{D}_{P}& \rightarrow L^2(R)\\
\psi &\mapsto -i\hbar\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\psi.
\end{aligned}
$$

We want to check if the operator is [[Self-adjoint and adjoint|self-adjoint]] for the case of a particle in 1D inifinite well and a particle in a 1D ring.

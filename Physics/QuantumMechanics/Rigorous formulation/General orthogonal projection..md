*Theorem:* Let $H$ be a Hilbert space. Suppose  $P\mathcal{L}(H,H)$ have the propeties
1. $P\circ P = P$
2. $\forall \psi,\phi \in H: \langle P\psi,\phi\rangle = \langle \psi,P\phi\rangle$.
Then the range/image of $P$ is closed and $P = P_{P(H)}$

Moral: any projector is the orthogonal projector to some sub-Hilbert space.


*Remark:* As of right now I am not sure about the significance of the above theorem. We have defined what an [[Orthogonal projection|orthogonal projection]] behaves like. The above map $P$ behaves in the same way. What is the difference? Is the above map more general?

Suppose we have map 
$$
A:V\rightarrow W
$$
where $V$ is a norm space meaning it is not complete and $W$ is a [[Banach space]].

*Definition:* A map $A$ is said to be bounded if 
$$
\sup_{f\in V}\frac{||Af||}{||f||}<\infty
$$

This means that we look at the least largest element of $f$ in $V$ and look at what it maps to after using the map $A$. If this is finite then the map $A$ is bounded. However, what do you mean by $\sup_{f\in V}$

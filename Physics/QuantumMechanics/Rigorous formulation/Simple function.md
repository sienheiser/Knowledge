*Definiton:* A [[Measureable maps|measureable function]] $s:M\rightarrow \mathbb{R}^+_0$ is called a simple function if 
$$
S(M) = \{s_1,...,s_N\}
$$
for some $N\in\mathbb{N}$.

The way to visualize simple function is to think of them as step functions with finite number of steps.

We can write a simple function $s$ as 
$$
s = \sum_{z\in s(M)}z\cdot \chi_{\text{preim}_s({z})}(z)
$$
where $\chi$ is the  [[Characteristic function|charateristic function]].

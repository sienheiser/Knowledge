*Theorem:* A norm on $||\cdot||:V\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is induced by a sesquilinear innerproduct iff the parallelogram identity 
$$
||f+g||+||f-g|| = 2||f||+2||g||\quad\forall f,g\in V
$$
holds. In this case, the inner product can be explicitly constructed as
$$
\langle f,g\rangle := \frac{1}{4}(||f+g||-||f-g||+i||f-ig||-i||f+ig||).
$$

### Momentum operator	
We want to define a proper domain for the momentum operator to act on. Let our inifinite well be defined on interval $I = [0,2\pi]$. We may guess the domain to be 
$$
\mathcal{D}_P :=\{\psi\in C^1(I)|\psi(0)=\psi(2\pi) = 0\}
$$
The functions in the $\mathcal{D}_P$ are once differetentiable continuous and are zero at the end points of the interval. The strategy to check if the given momentum operator in [[Case study momentum operator.|case study momentum operator]] is [[Self-adjoint and adjoint|self-adjoint]] is:
1. Check if it is a [[Symmetric operator|symmetric operator]].
2. Calculate its adjoint domain
3. Compare the original domain and the adjoint domain.

We check the symmetry [[Symmetry of 1D momentum operator|here]]. We calculate the adjoint of the momentum operator [[Adjoint of 1D momentum operator (infinite well)#Adjoint]]. We saw with the given domain defined above the momentum operator is not self-adjoint. Furthermore in [[Adjoint of 1D momentum operator (infinite well)#Essentially self adjoint]] we say that is not even essentially self adjoint. Finally we say in [[Adjoint of 1D momentum operator (infinite well)#Essentially self adjoint]] using the defect indiced that there exists a self adjoint momentum operator.

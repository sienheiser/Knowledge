### Momentum operator
We want to define a proper domain for the momentum operator to act on. Let our inifinite well be defined on interval $I = [0,2\pi]$. We may guess the domain to be 
$$
\mathcal{D}_P :=\{\psi\in C^1(I)|\psi(0)=\psi(2\pi)\}.
$$
Now we have a cyclic boundary condition.

We do the same procedure of finding the adjoin of the momentum operator for the 1D ring as we did for the 1D inifinite well [[Adjoint of 1D momentum operator (infinite well)|here]].

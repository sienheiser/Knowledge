*Definiton:* the integral $\int fd\mu$ of an [[Integrable functions|integrable function]] is defined as 
$$
\int fd\mu := \int f^+d\mu-\int f^-d\mu.
$$

*Remark:* In QM we need to deal with complex functions. Their integration theory follows from treating $\Re(f)$ and $\Im(f)$ seperately
$$
\int fd\mu := \int \Re(f)d\mu+i\int \Im(f)d\mu
$$
and then applying the definiton above to the real and imaginary part.

We have defined what is the [[Density Operator|density operater]]. We will look at some properties of the density operator. 

1. The density operator is Hermitian because of the way it is defined i.e. $\hat{\rho}=\sum_i w_i |\alpha^{(i)}\rangle\langle\alpha^{(i)}|$. Remeber $w_i$ is real.
2.  The trace of the density operator equals to one: $\text{tr}(\hat{\rho}) = \sum_i \sum_{b'}w_i\langle b'|\alpha^{(i)}\rangle\langle\alpha^{(i)}|b'\rangle = \sum_i w_i \langle \alpha^{(i)}|\alpha^{(i)}\rangle = 1$ given that all the states $|\alpha^{(i)}\rangle$ are normalized.

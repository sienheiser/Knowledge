#QuantumMechanics 


So far we have dealt with ensembles of identical system. What we mean is that each system can be represented by the same state ket $|\alpha\rangle$. For example, after we allow silver atom to pass through a filter that only allows particles along z-axis spin up. All the atoms are represented by the same state ket $|S_z,+\rangle$. The collection of these atoms is known as the emsemble (ensembles are also described in [[Finding the statistical distribution|finding statisitcal distribution]] 2nd paragraph). Each atom in the ensemble is represented by the same state ket.

What if we want to describe the state of the atoms right after they are prepared but before they enter a spin filter? Before the atoms enter the filter that seperates spin up from spin down along the z-axis, we expect 50% of the atoms to spin up and the other 50% to be spin down. This situation is akin to having a class where 50% of students are male and the remaining 50% are female. If we pick a student at random there is a 50% change that the student is male, there no talk about linear super position.

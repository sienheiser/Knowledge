The covariant derivative of a vector field on a manifold is the generalization of a partial derivative of a vector field in flat space. Essentially I believe the covariant derivative does the same thing as the partial derivative the with limiting formula. The covariant derivative of a vector $V^{\nu}$ is given as

$$
\nabla_\mu V^{\nu} = \partial_\mu V^{\nu}+\Gamma_{\mu\lambda}^{\nu}V^{\lambda}.
$$

The covariant derivative compares the instantaneous rate of change of a tensor field compared to if the tensor would have been parallel transported. 

To understand the above statement, suppose we define a tensor field $T^{\mu\nu}(x^{\alpha})$ on a section of a manifold. Naturally there is no meaning in comparing two tensors at two different points $x^{\alpha}$ and $x^{\beta}$. Now taking the covariant derivative of the tensor field gives another new tensor field. Take the tensor at $x^{\alpha}$ and parallel transport it to point $x^{\beta}$, if the parallel transpoted tensor and the tensor $T^{\mu\nu}(\x^{\beta})$ are different

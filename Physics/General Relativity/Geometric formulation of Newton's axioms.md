A Newtonion space time is a quintuple 
$$
(M,\mathcal{O},\mathcal{A},\nabla,t)
$$
where  $(M,\mathcal{O},\mathcal{A}$ is a 4D smooth manifold and $t$ is a smooth function $t:M\rightarrow R$ satisfying
1. There is absolute space meaning at a time $\tau$. Absolute space at absolute time $\tau$ is the set $S_\tau = \{p \in M|t(p) = \tau \}$ which basically is all the points on $M$ that have time $\tau$. For this to be possible $(dt)_p \neq 0$ for all points in $M$.
2. Absolute time flows uniformly $\nabla dt = 0$ where $\nabla$ is a (0,2) tensor field.
3.  $\nabla$ is torsion free.

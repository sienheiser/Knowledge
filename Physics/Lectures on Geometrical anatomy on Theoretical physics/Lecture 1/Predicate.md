*Definiton:* A **predicate** is a proposition valued function of some variable(s).

*Remark:* We can construct new prediates from given ones.

*Remark:* We can convert one variable predicate into a [[Propositional logic|proposition]]:
$$\forall x: P(x).$$
The above statement reads as for all $x$ $P(x)$ is true.

Now we look at the existence qualification. 
*Definition:* existence qualification:
$$
\exists x: P(x)\iff\neg(\forall x:\neg P(x)).
$$
The above statement reads as 'There exists $x$ such that $P(x)$ is true.'

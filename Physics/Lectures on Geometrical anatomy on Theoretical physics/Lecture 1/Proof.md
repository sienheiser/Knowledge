*Definition:* A proof of a proposition $p$ within an [[Axiomatic system|axiomatic system]] $a_1,...,a_N$ is a finite sequence of propositions $q_1,...,q_M$ such that for any $1\leq j < M$ either

(A) $q_j$ is a proposition form the list of axioms
(T) $q_j$ is a tautology
(M) "Modus ponens" $\exists 1 < m,n \leq j:q_m\land q_n\implies q_j$ is true.

*Remark:* If $p$ is proven from $a_1,...,a_N$ we write $\vdash P$.

This definiton allows us to recognize a proof but does not tell us how to make a proof.

### Axiom
There exists a set that contains the empty set and with every of its elements $y$ it also contains $\{y\}$ as an element.


*Remark:* One such set is, informally speaking, the set w/ elements 
$$
\emptyset,\{\emptyset\},\{\{\emptyset\}\},\{\{\{\emptyset\}\}\},...
$$
We may label these elements as $1 : = \{\emptyset\}, 2 :=\{\{\emptyset\}\}, 3:= \{\{\{\emptyset\}\}\},...$

*Corollary:* $\mathbb{N}$ being a set is a direct consequence of the axiom of infinity.

We may construct $\mathbb{R} = \mathcal{P}(\mathbb{N})$.

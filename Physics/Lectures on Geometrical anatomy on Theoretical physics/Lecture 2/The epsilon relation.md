Set theory is built on the postulate that there is a fundemental relation called $\in$. There will be no definiton of what $\in$ is, or of what a set is.

Instead of that we use 9 axioms of $\in$ and sets to define their behaviours

### Defining $\notin$ 
We define a [[Predicate|predicate]] $\notin(x,y)$. We denote this predicate as $\notin(x,y)=: x\notin y$. We define $x\notin y\iff \neg x\in y$.

### Defining $\subseteq$
We define $\subseteq$ as
$$
x\subseteq y \iff \forall a:(a\in x\implies a\in y)
$$
We define equality between sets as 
$$
x = y\iff x\subseteq y \land y\subseteq x.
$$

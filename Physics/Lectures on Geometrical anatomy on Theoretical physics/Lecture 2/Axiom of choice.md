Let $x$ be a set whose elements are non-empty and mutually disjoint. Then there exists a set $y$ which contains exactly one element of each element of $x$.

$$
\forall x:\bigcap x=\emptyset:a,b\in x:a\neq b:a,b\neq\emptyset\implies \exists y: c\in y\iff !c\in a\in x.
$$
*Remark:* Axiom of choise is independet of the other 8 axioms. Could have set theory without it.

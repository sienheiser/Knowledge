*Definition:* A **paracompact** **Hausdoff** [[Axioms|topological space]] $(M,\mathcal{O})$ is called a $d$-dimensional (topological) manifold if for every $p\in M$ there exists [[Neighbourhood|neighbourhood]] $U\in\mathcal{O}$ such that $p\in U\in\mathcal{O}$ and a [[Homeomorphism|homeomorphism]] $x:U\rightarrow x(U)\subseteq\mathbb{R}^d$.


### Constructing new manifolds from old manifolds

#### Submanifolds
If we have a manifold $(M,\mathcal{O})$ we may construct a submanifold by using the subspace topology defined [[Subspace|here]]. If the resulting space is a manifold in its own right then it is called a submanifold.

#### Product manifolds
If we have two manifolds $(M,\mathcal{O}_M)$ and $(N,\mathcal{O}_N)$ then $(M\times N,\mathcal{O}_{M\times N})$, where $\mathcal{O}_{M\times N}$ is the **product topology**, us a topological manifold of dimension $\text{dim}M+\text{dim}N$.

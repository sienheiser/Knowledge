*Definiton:*  $E\stackrel{\pi}{\rightarrow}M$, $E'\stackrel{\pi '}{\rightarrow}M'$ be two [[Physics/Lectures on Geometrical anatomy on Theoretical physics/Lecture 6/Bundles|bundles]] and consider two maps $u:E\rightarrow E'$, $f: M\rightarrow M'$. Then $(u,f)$ is a **bundle morphism** if $\pi '\circ u = f\circ \pi$.  ![[bundlemorphism.jpg]]
The diagram shows that going to the right and then down is the same as going down and then right.

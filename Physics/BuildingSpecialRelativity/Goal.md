Our goal is to use the definitons we have learned through the Geometrical Anatomy of theoretical physics and build and example that uses all those definitons.

Since curvature is everywhere in GR we start by understanding the definitons of curvature.

*Definiton:* Let 
$$
P\stackrel{\triangleleft G}{\longrightarrow} P \stackrel{\pi}{\longrightarrow} M
$$
be a ***principal $G$-bundle*** with a ***connection one form $\omega$***. Then the curvature of the connection (one-form) is the *Lie algebra valued 2-form* on $P$
$$
\begin{aligned}
	\Omega:&\Gamma(T^2_0P)\longrightarrow T_eG\\
	&\Omega:= D\omega
\end{aligned}
$$
where $D$ is the ***covariant exterior derivative***.

We try to understand this through building an example. We start by understanding the principal $G$-bundle $P$.

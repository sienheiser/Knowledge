## Abstract
Using this [[Making a Bundle|example]] of a bundle. We construct a fibre bundle.

## Construction of a fibre bundle

We have defined fibre bundles [[Physics/Lectures on Geometrical anatomy on Theoretical physics/Lecture 6/Bundles|here]]. We take the example from [[Making a Bundle|before]] and make it into a fibre bundle by introducing a fibre $F$. So now we have $(\mathit{C}^1\times\mathbb{R},\pi,\mathit{C}^1,F=\mathbb{R})$ where we have set the fibre $F$ to be $\mathbb{R}$. This is an example of a trivial fibre bundle because it is globally satisfying the definiton of fibre bundle i.e. 

$$
\forall p\in\mathit{C}^1:\text{preim}_\pi(\{p\})\cong F.
$$
where $\cong$ represensts a homeomorphism.

The [[Making a Bundle#Cartesian Chart|Cartesian chart]]  defined for the example is not affected by the introduction of the fibres.

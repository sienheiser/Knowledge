Once there were two travelers. They went from one city to another city.

The sun was shining and it was very hot. They were very tired and could no longer walk.

"See. A tree! It's so shady under there. We can go and rest under the tree. "

“Mr. Tree, can I rest under you? It is very hot, ”said the traveler to the tree.

"But of course" said the tree and the travelers came and sat under the tree.

After some time the travelers looked up the tree and saw that there were no fruits.

“My dear tree, have you no fruits?” said the travelers to the tree

"No, I can't make any fruits," said the tree to the travelers, smiling broadly.

“Oh okay. So you can't give me food to eat,” said the travelers, grinning.

After some time the travelers looked up the tree and saw that there were no flowers.

“My dear tree, have you no flowers?” said the travelers to the tree

"No, I can't make any flowers," said the tree to the travelers, smiling broadly.

“Oh okay. So you can't give me any flowers to smell,” said the travelers, grinning.

After some time the travelers looked up into the tree and saw that the wood was very weak.

"My dear trees, don't you have any strong wood that we can use?" said the travelers to the tree

"No, my wood is weak," said the tree to the travelers, smiling broadly.

“Oh okay. So you can't give me anything useful. You cannot make good fruits. You cannot make smelling flowers. You cannot make strong firewood. You must be the most useless tree of all. And yet you smile like a fool, ”said the travelers, laughing.

“Don't be so ungrateful. I may not produce flowers with a good smell. I may not produce good fruit. I may not produce strong wood. But right now I'm giving you shade from the sun. You are refreshed and alive only because of me,” said the tree, continuing to smile.

Moral: All God's creations have a good purpose. We should never belittle God's creations.

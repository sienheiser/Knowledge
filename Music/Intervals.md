### Interval numbers
As an example we take C major scale. There are four major intervals and four perfect intervals in the C major scale.

The second, third, sixth and seventh intervals in the C major scale are major intervals. Explicitly C-D (2nd), C-E (3rd), C-A (6th) and C-B (7th) are the major intervals. 

There are also four perfect intervals. These intervals are called perfect because remain the same in the C minor scale. The 1st, 4th, 5th and 8th intervals are the perfect intervals. Explicitly C-C (1st), C-F (4th), C-G (5th) and C-C (8th or octave).


### Interval quality

If we start with a perfect interval. We can create an **augmented interval** if we raise the top note of the perfect interval by a semitone. We can create a **diminised interval** if we lower the top note by a semitone. 

If we start with a [[Major and minor triad|major]] interval. We can create an **augmented interval** if we raise the top note of the major interval by a semitone. We can create a **minor interval** if we lower the top note by a semitone.

If we start with a [[Major and minor triad|minor]] interval. We can create a major interval if we raise the top note of the minor interval by a semitone. We can create a **diminished interval** if we lower the top note by a semitone.

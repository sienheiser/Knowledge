## Achievements over the past two years
### Coding
1. Built scripts that helped with generation of test specifications: https://gitlab.esss.lu.se/emmanueldcosta/specification-generator
	1. I came onto the job as a technical writer. We were going to start a big testing phase which required many test specification for different systems. I built a database that collected relevant data for our group and wrote scripts to generate the test specifications.
2. Built a website for the team to get overview information: https://gitlab.esss.lu.se/emmanueldcosta/mps-overview 
	1. Here I learnt how to display information in the database I built to website. It is still under development. I learned how to make a basic web app.
3. Built a package to run VBA commands through python: https://gitlab.esss.lu.se/emmanueldcosta/pyword 
	1. When I initially started scripting documents I had to write code in VBA. VBA made it difficult to track code because the code is stored in MS office documents. My colleague and I were able to find a work around that that allows us to use python instead. 
### Testing
I have been part of 3 big testing campaigns. These testing campaigns have taught me the value of having convinent ways to record information.

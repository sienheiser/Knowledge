## Scene 2
Let us place the green cylinder $E$ at the top and the orange circle $M$ at the bottom. We can then choose the following projection: we simply view the orange circle as a shadow of the green cylinder. 

To understand how this projection behaves we place a red dot on the green cylinder and a blue dot on the orange circle. If we move the red dot vertically, nothing happens to the blue dot. If we move the red dot with some horizontal movement, then as you can see the blue dot follows. 

If we introduce coordinates for both the dots, then we can see that the first two coordinates of the red dot is the same as the two coordinates of the blue dot. Essentially this projection removes the third coordinate of the red dot. In this manner we have constructed our first bundle.

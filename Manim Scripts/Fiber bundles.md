  Hello, today I will be breaking down the definition of a fiber bundle. The first part of the definition talks about a bundle. We will choose the following bundle: A cylinder projected to a circle where the projection is as follows. Take a red point, if it moves vertically and we trace its path  in red, this line is projected t o a point on the circle. This true where ever we are in the cylinder. Vertical lines get projected to a point. 

The second part of the definition focuses on the circle. It states that "If for all points p belonging to the circle the preimage of pi for each point is equal to an F where F is some manifold.". What does this mean? Let us look at our circle and place a blue point, if we input this point into the preimage of pi we get a line. We can do this for other points also and we will always get a line. This line is the F in our definition. 

The third part of the definition just says that all these objects together give us a fiber bundle. 

Finally, I would like to talk about notation. We have the following fiber bundle that will be used in future videos. Right now the circle is called $M$ and the cylinder $E$. These are just generic labels. From now onwards we will call the circle as $\mathit{C}^1$ where $1$ stands for one dimensional. So C two would be a sphere. The cylinder will be called as C one cartesian product R where R is the set of real numbers.
